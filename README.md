Manzil is a metro route-finding app designed to help users navigate Karachi's metro system. Built using Django for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend, this app uses Dijkstra's Algorithm and graph theory to calculate the most efficient routes between metro stations.

Features

Route Calculation: Find the shortest path between two metro stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive UI built with Bootstrap.

Data Verification: The app pulls data from independent sources, ensuring that it's verified for accuracy before use.

Tech Stack

Backend: Django

Frontend: Bootstrap

Algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm (for route optimization)

Data Sources: Independently collected and validated data
